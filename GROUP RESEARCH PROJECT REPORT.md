## Declaration
This research paper is the product of an independent study aimed at analyzing the evolving role of retail investors in the financial markets. The insights, data, and conclusions presented within are based on both primary and secondary sources, gathered and analyzed with the objective of offering a deeper understanding of retail investor behavior, particularly in terms of financial literacy, demographics, and influence on market dynamics. This project is intended solely for educational purposes and should not be considered financial advice.

## Introduction
Traditional investors in the financial markets have historically been limited, on one side, to large financial institutions, such as investment banks or equity funds, and on the other, individuals with substantial liquid capital, whether in savings or disposable income. With the term 'investor', a different entity was seldom referred to. They were the market makers and the market movers.
In recent years, however, a new actor has gained considerable influence in the movements and speculations of financial markets: the retail investor. Retail investors are rarely market movers on their own, their capital is limited and often buy and sell with limited knowledge of the concerned industry. Their choices are often influenced by volatile trends inflated by social media and similar channels of communication, and behavioural patterns such as herd investing and panick selling have become the norm. Individually they may have no remarkable influence, but as their numbers grow and the herding patterns start to appear, their role in the speculative markets no longer becomes a phenomenon that financial institutions and professional analysts can ignore.
It is therefore our aim with this research project to seek and provide enough substantial data that may help better recognize and categorize some of the most common charachteristics amongst retail investors, focusing primarily on their financial literacy and demographics, so that new insights may be provided to investors and analysts in potential portfolio management and creation.
